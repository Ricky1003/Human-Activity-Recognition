- The objective of the data collection process is the improvement of the classification performance of learned model for HAR (Human Activity Recognition) purpose using smartphone which contains sensors such as gyroscopes, accelerometeres and microphones instead of number of different "purpose sensors" against the previous available version which had less features.

- Types of human activity that were involved in the experiment are standing, sitting, laying down, walking downstairs and upstairs. Number of people performed this experiment are 30.

- Number of instances in the training and testing data are 10299. Number of features that are used to represent each instance are 561. Features that are extracted are the data collected from the mobile phone sensors such as gyroscope and accelerometer. The data consists of tri-axial linear acceleration and tri-axial angular velocity of subjects wearing the device at specified part of the body.

- The machine learning model that is used in the experiment is "multiclass support vector machine". The model is trained on the data collected from cell phone's gyroscope and accelerometer sensors which provided more number of features as compared to the data that was previously held. The maximum accuracy that is achieved by multiclass SVM is 96%.
